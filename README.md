# SpecSensingSDR
Our custom-designed hardware platform design for spectrum sensing that uses fully programmable architecture
and it can also be used for general software-defined radio platform.

#Schematic
The circuit design of each blocks, including ZYNQ 7020 FPGA circuit, power module, USB and Ethernet interface, and the analog front end design with AD9361.

#PCB
The layout of the hardware by Cadence

#SDK
The firmware demo that senses the frequency bands' spectrum sequentially.
